# HOWTO Setup a personal GitHub Account

Before you can start using GitHub, you need to register your own GitHub account.

To register a new account, visit [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and find the 'Sign up' option on their website, 
or visit this page directly: [**https://github.com/join**](https://github.com/join)

- **Step 1: Set up your account**

Choose your new GitHub **username**, specify your existing **email** address (it's important to use your real email address because we will need to verify our account when we finalize the registration process) and the **password** of your choosing.

# 1. What is GitHub?

GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories.  You can use Git on its own without Github (and other similar platforms), but it's difficult to collaborate or share your code with. others.

- **Git is the version control system, the tool that tracks changes to our files over time**
- **Github is a hosting service for projects that use Git.**

Make sure to first familiarize yourself with Git before proceeding.
Check out my **Learn Git In 15 Minutes** tutorial [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) (also, you can find the Git notes [**here**](https://www.notion.so/Introduction-to-Git-ac396a0697704709a12b6a0e545db049)).

Git is used to store projects inside *repositories* and track the complete history of all changes to the project code. Using GitHub, we can upload a local project repository to a remote cloud-based GitHub repository. We can also interact with public repositories published by other developers.

GitHub could even be looked at as a social networking website for developers. Users can follow each other, give ratings, collaborate and communicate.

GitHub allows developers to utilize, change or improve software from its repositories. Each repository contains all project files and the code history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

GitHub is also a popular way developers to publish their project portfolio online. It's an easy way to showcase skills and experience to potential employers or clients.  It's an important technology to be familiar with, especially for a new developer who is just starting out.
