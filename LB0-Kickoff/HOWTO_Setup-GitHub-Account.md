# HOWTO Setup a personal GitHub Account

Before you can start using GitHub, you need to register your own GitHub account.

To register a new account, visit [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and find the 'Sign up' option on their website, 
or visit this page directly: [**https://github.com/join**](https://github.com/join)

- **Step 1: Set up your account**

Choose your new GitHub **username**, specify your existing **email** address (it's important to use your real email address because we will need to verify our account when we finalize the registration process) and the **password** of your choosing.
